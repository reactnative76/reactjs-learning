        question: "What is the need of Reactjs",
        answer: "Angular is not just a typical upgrade but a totally new development. The whole framework is rewritten from the ground. Angular got rid of many things like $scope, controllers, DDO, jqLite, angular.module etc. It uses components for almost everything. Imagine that even the whole app is now a component. Also it takes advantage of ES6 / TypeScript syntax. Developing Angular apps in TypeScript has made it even more powerful. . Apart from that, many things have evolved and re-designed like the template engine and many more."

        question: "What is SPA (Single Page Application) ?",
        answer: "The term “single-page application” (or SPA) is usually used to describe applications that were built for the web. These applications are accessed via a web browser like other websites, but offer more dynamic interactions resembling native mobile and desktop apps. The most notable difference between a regular website and an SPA is the reduced amount of page refreshes. In our normal application what happens is entire page is reloaded when we move from one part of application to another part of application. But in case of SPA, we simply replace one view with the other view in our content areas instead of loading the complete page again. It keeps track of history. It means we can restore the application in its required state when user moves forward or backward. It also provides fast and fluidic experience."
